## Introduction

The Tektork IoT Kit V1.0  is the second in the series of boards released by Tektork Private Limited, Coimbatore.
It is an all in one kit to get you started on embedded, IoT and Cyber Physical Systems development.

### About the Board

The  Tektork IoT Kit V1.0 comes with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. It is based on the Espressif ESP32-WROOM Series.
It can be connected to a PC via a USB Type - C connector for power, programming and serial communication.
The board also contains
- 2 Programmable LEDs
- 1 LDR
- 1 Potentiometer
- 1 Programmable Switch
The board has custom made connectors for various commonly used sensors and modules:
- 3-Axis Gyroscope and AccelerometerMPU6050
- CAN Transceiver TJA105
- USB2UART FT232 Module
- 8 MB SPI based Data Flash module W25Q128

This enables simple plug-and-play use.

Other modules using the same protocols will need to be connected to these interfaces using jumper wires if their pinouts don't match the connectors on the board.

## Getting Started

To begin learning about the Tektork IoT Kit V1.0  (ESP32) complete the setup by refering to the [setup-docs](SETUP.md). Post setup, head over to the [basics/blink](basics/blink) directory to get started.
